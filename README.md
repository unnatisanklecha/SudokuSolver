# SudokuSolver

This repository contains a Sudoku solver implemented using the backtracking algorithm and various data structures and algorithms (DSA). Sudoku is a popular puzzle game that involves filling a 9x9 grid with numbers so that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. This project demonstrates how to solve Sudoku puzzles efficiently using a backtracking approach while applying fundamental DSA principles.

Key Features:-
1. Backtracking Algorithm: The solver utilizes the backtracking algorithm to efficiently search for a solution while maintaining consistency with Sudoku rules.
2. Data Structures: This project showcases the implementation and use of data structures such as arrays and matrices to represent the Sudoku grid. Additionally, it employs techniques like constraint propagation and pruning for optimization.
3. User-Friendly Interface: The solver may include a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) to input and display Sudoku puzzles, making it accessible for users to interact with the solver.
